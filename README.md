# allthingsDL
A repository containing end-to-end implementation of various ML algorithms using PyTorch

Welcome to "allthingsDL", a comprehensive repository that encapsulates my journey through Deep Learning. Each project in this repository has been meticulously crafted from scratch to demonstrate my proficiency and understanding in various domains of machine learning, with a particular focus on PyTorch. This repository serves not only as a portfolio of my personal projects but also as a resource for anyone looking to delve deeper into the practical applications of deep learning.

### Repository Structure
This repository is divided into four main sections, each focusing on different aspects of deep learning:

1. Deep Learning Step by Step
This section is a personal documentation of my journey learning PyTorch. It includes 8 folders, each dedicated to a specific machine learning concept. The content ranges from basic to advanced topics, all implemented in PyTorch:

Folder 1: [Specific concept] - Includes Jupyter notebook with detailed explanations and code.
Folder 2-8: [Other concepts] - Each folder follows the same structured format.
Each notebook within these folders is structured to provide a comprehensive guide through the code, data handling, and theoretical concepts, ensuring a holistic learning experience.

2. Computer Vision
In this section, I explore three critical projects in Computer Vision, utilizing PyTorch for building and training models:

CIFAR Classification: Deep dive into image recognition with CIFAR dataset.
Face Classification: Techniques and models for distinguishing facial features and identities.
MNIST Classification: Classic digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.
These projects are well-documented from data preprocessing and model building to training and evaluation, showcasing end-to-end project development.

3. Regression
This folder focuses on regression tasks, applying deep learning models to predict continuous outcomes. Each project within this section is structured to demonstrate the complete workflow of a regression problem, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

4. Textual ML
Dedicated to projects involving textual data, this section includes:

News Classification: Implementation of TFIDF vectorization, data scaling, normalization, and machine learning model training and evaluation.
MiniGPT: Inspired by the "Attention is all you need" paper, this folder documents my process of building a language model from scratch using the Transformer architecture, followed by training, evaluating, and text generation.
